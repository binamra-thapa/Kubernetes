1. Why 
what problem does Kubernetes solve 
waht are the issues when operating laarge containerized apps 
what are the benefits of using k8s 

2. Architecture:
    Control Plane and worker Nodes, 
    roles of each, how are they connected, what processes run on them 

3. Core objects in k8s 
    pod, svc, cm, secret , ing, deployment, statefulsets, ns, volume
    what is the purpose and relation between each other 

4. Kubernetes Components 
    control plane: scheduler, controler-manager, etcd, api-server
    worker node:  kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime 
   what does each component do and the role of each component.
   Understanding the mechanisms behind the cluster: self-healing, desired vs actual, scanning deployments 

5. Access and interact with k8s 
    learn kubectl and its main commands 
    creating, modifying, deleting resources, querying the cluster's state and status 

6. k8s manifest files
    learn syntax of k8s manifest files 
    declerative way of creating k8s object 
    how to create and manage these configuration files
    [deployment, service, stateful set, ]

7. TroubleShooting:
    kubectl commands for troubleshooting 
    how to get insights into the cluster 
    insights of cluster networking, component configuration, etc 

8. Common K8s Misconfiguration 

9. Helm Charts
    what is helm 
    what are helm charts 
    what are they used for 
    how to create and use helm charts
